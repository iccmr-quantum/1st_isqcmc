# Introduction
### 1st International Symposium on Quantum Computing and Musical Creativity

Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is advancing rapidly. 

There is a long history of research into using computers for music since the 1950s. Nowadays computers are essential for the music economy. Therefore, is very likely that quantum computers will impact the music industry in the time to come. A new area of research and development is emerging, _Quantum Computer Music_.

This first-ever quantum computer music symposium focuses on quantum computing for musical creativity. It takes place in the context of the [QuTune Project](https://iccmr-quantum.github.io/), developed at the [University of Plymouth's ICCMR](http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/) in collaboration with [Cambridge Quantum Computing](https://cambridgequantum.com/).  In addition to creating resources for quantum computer music, QuTune is aimed at fostering a quantum-ready music tech community of early adopters.

The symposium will comprise talks about the resources being developed by the QuTune team and works by invited presenters. It will include a hands-on introduction to programming quantum computing for musicians and practical demonstrations. And we welcome proposals for presentations (see How to participate below).

The symposium will take place online and attendance is free of charge. But places are limited. 

# Organisers
- Eduardo R. Miranda (ICCMR, University of Plymouth, UK)
- Bob Coecke (Cambridge Quantum Computing, UK)
- Omar Costa Hamido (ICCMR, University of Plymouth, UK)
- Paulo Itaborai (ICCMR, University of Plymouth, UK)
- Suchitra Basak (ICCMR, University of Plymouth, UK)
- Scott Oshiro (CCRMA, Stanford University, USA)
- Enrique Solano (Kipu Quantum, Germany)

# How to participate

The target audience for this symposium is musicians interested in experimenting with quantum computers for musical composition and/or performance. Quantum computing developers and researchers interested in music are also welcome. 

A background in computer music and/or music technology is required to follow the presentations. Previous experience with computer programming, in particular Python, is required to follow the tutorial. Previous knowledge of quantum computing is not required but would be beneficial.

To express your interest to participate, please fill in the form (link below).  The organizing team will contact you after the application deadline. If you are selected, then you will be given further instructions to access the event.

We are very keen to welcome those who already have been working with quantum computer music to present their work. Should you wish to present, please tell us so on the form, where there is space to write an abstract of your work. Should you qualify for a presentation, we will send you instructions for writing a paper. We are planning to publish a selection of papers as a special issue of _Contemporary Music Journal_.
