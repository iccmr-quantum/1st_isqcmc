# Introduction
### 1st International Symposium on Quantum Computing and Musical Creativity

Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is advancing rapidly. 

There is a long history of research into using computers for music since the 1950s. Nowadays computers are essential for the music economy. Therefore, it is very likely that quantum computers will impact the music industry in the time to come. A new area of research and development is emerging: _Quantum Computer Music_.

This first-ever quantum computer music symposium focuses on quantum computing for musical creativity. It takes place in the context of the [QuTune Project](https://iccmr-quantum.github.io/), and is organised by [University of Plymouth's ICCMR](http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/) in collaboration with [Cambridge Quantum Computing](https://cambridgequantum.com/) and [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/). In addition to creating resources for quantum computer music, QuTune is aimed at fostering a quantum-ready music tech community of early adopters.

The envisaged programme comprises talks about the resources being developed by the QuTune team and works by invited presenters. It offers a hands-on introduction to programming quantum computers for musicians and practical demonstrations. We welcome proposals for presentations (see [How to participate](#how-to-participate) below).

The symposium will take place online and attendance is free of charge. Places are limited, [registration](https://forms.gle/z6nKn7SPPPGhWFfQA) is required.

# How to participate

The target audience for this symposium is musicians interested in reflecting on and experimenting with quantum computers for musical composition and/or performance. Quantum computing developers and researchers interested in music are welcome. 

A background in computer music and/or music technology is recommended in order to follow the presentations. Previous experience with computer programming, in particular Python, is also recommended to benefit from the tutorial. Familiarity with quantum computing is not mandatory, but would be advantageous. ([Here](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/what-is-quantum-computing/) is a good place to start. A good popular science explanation with a short video is [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-quantum-computing-so-hard-to-explain-20210608/)).

To express your interest in participating, please fill in the form (link to access the form is below).  The organizing team will contact you after the application deadline. If you are selected, then you will be given further instructions to access the event.

We are very keen to welcome those who already have been working with quantum computer music to present their work. If you wish to present, then please let us know. There is space on the form to briefly describe the work that you would like to present. Should you qualify for a presentation, then we will send you instructions for writing a short paper. We are planning to publish a selection of papers as a special issue of _Contemporary Music Journal_.

<strike>Deadline for application: **03 September 2021, 22:00 GMT**. (Please note: deadline is changed to early September. Due to surprising number of applicants, the team will need more time to process the forms and prepare for the event.)</strike>

#### Application for this event is now closed. We will contact applicants soon.
